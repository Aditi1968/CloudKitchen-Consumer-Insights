Subject: Exploring Bengaluru’s Cloud Kitchen Trends

Hi {Founder Name},

I'm running a focused study on Bengaluru’s food-tech and cloud-kitchen ecosystem.
Your inputs would help paint an accurate picture of consumer preferences and operational challenges.

Would you be open to a short call (15–20 mins) this week? Happy to share a summary of the findings with you.

Thanks,
{Your Name}
